## Create GoodRelations Rich Snippets Embedded in XHTML for Your Business ##

With this tool, you can create rich data snippets using the W3C RDFa format for simple copy-and-paste. Just insert them into your Web pages and update the XHTML/HTML page header markup.
This makes the unique features of your products and services more accessible for the latest generation of search engines (e.g. Yahoo !SearchMonkey), novel mobile applications, and browser plug-ins. Plus, it brings positive effects on existing search engines (e.g. [Google](http://www.heppresearch.com/gr4google)).

This tool was deployed as a service at http://www.ebusiness-unibw.org/tools/grsnippetgen/

It is currently only available in English, German, Turkish and Greek. We would enjoy (contact the developer) to see if someone voluntary was interested to translate the tool into other international languages as well. The language files in the language directory can be used as references: http://code.google.com/p/grsnippetgen/source/browse/#hg/lang
